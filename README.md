# AngularTutorial

##Why Angular?
  * The Problem with databinding with jquery (jquery is like classic asp for javascript?!)
  * Angular is an mvc framework for javascript

##The basics
  * Step1: Start with a WebAPI
  * Step1: Creating an Angular App (module system, ng-App, _references.js)
  * Step1: Adding a controller (ng-controller, Databinding)
  * Step2: Getting Data with $http (Dependency injection)
  * Step2: View binding (ng-repeat, format filters)
  * Step3: Add a new sprint (ng-show, ng-click)
  * Step4: Adding form validation (mandatory, number, css)
  * Step4: Refactoring to a service (factory create an object)


##We're not using SPAs or angular2 yet here's why
  * routing on the client is harder
  * Angular2, typescript modules etc
